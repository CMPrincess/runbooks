# Main Ceremony Host (MC) Role

While the MC role is a day-of role that does not have a specific organizer function, there are a number of key elements that are required for a good MC. You can think of a good MC from any awards show or variety show---innocuous, friendly, and lightly entertaining without being abrasive or controversial.

## Role description

This role is the face of each talk track. The person who fills this role introduces speakers, kicks off and moderates Q&A, fills in empty airtime that isn't taken by a break, and helps a speaker feel more comfortable on stage should technical issues arise or should a speaker speed through their talk.

### General Tasks

* Ensures their pronunciation of speaker names are correct.
* Introduces each speaker on their assigned stage.
* Generates questions during a talk to fill in Q&A if it gets quiet.
* Talks with the speaker during technical difficulties or otherwise entertains the audience to reduce speaker anxiety.
* Makes announcements as necessary on each stage.

## Important Dates

### Before the speaker dinner

* Write up and practice your introductions.
* Consider gathering light jokes, stories, or other things that you can fill in empty air with---whatever is authentically you.

### At the speaker dinner

* Introduce yourself to the speakers on your stage.
* Gather as many pronunciations as possible.
* Check on speaker details with speakers who are present.

### Day of

* Be there for tech checks to ensure you know who might have issues.
* Welcome attendees to your track.
* Help speakers who seem nervous to settle in before their talk begins (e.g., being a friendly face to talk with if they want that, or encouraging approaching people to talk after if they need space)
* Announce each speaker on your track.
* If technical difficulties arise, fill in the time so that the speaker can relax (e.g., asking the speaker easy questions about the topic or about the weather while the A/V team works, joking a bit with the audience at the expense of no one).
* Throughout the talk, come up with questions or key points to highlight during Q&A.
* After the talk, encourage applause, then start Q&A.
* If there are no questions immediately, warm up the room with a question or two of your own.
* After Q&A, encourage applause.
* Make announcements as necessary, and announce which session is next where.
* Tell the speaker how much you appreciated their talk, along with one or two points that went well. Make them feel accomplished.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

What do you always try to remember when you come back to this every year? Do you often find yourself scrambling for vendors? Are you always trying to remember where you left your towel? Leave notes for the next person so we can improve :)
